# VScodium
VSCodium, but you can build it offline. This repository exists to produce source tarballs that can be built offline, without having to download additional packages with npm or yarn. This is primarily a proof-of-concept to see if a VSCodium package can built for the official Debian archive, but support for offline building on other platforms may be included later.

# !! Work in Progress !!
This project is in the early stages of development. Currently, it does not work. It may never work. I'm just trying to see if it's possible.
